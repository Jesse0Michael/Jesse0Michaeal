# Demo Day

The goal of this format of demoing is to share what's new between teams in an engineering organization. The target audience is the engineers. I have found this method really helpful in consistently providing valuable information without being a time sink.

> The goal for this structure of demo's is not to keep product and other stakeholders up to date on the status of tasks from a prior sprint. Although these demo will be valuable to those parties, they are not the target audience. This format is not intended to replace a normal sprint review.

-----------------------------------------------

A demo day should be a consistently scheduled meeting that is "hosted" by a different team each occurrence on an ongoing rotation. It is the expectation that all members of the team will be able to demo something when their team is hosting the meeting.

- The frequency of the Demo Day meeting should be weekly or bi-weekly, depends on the number of teams
- The meeting should last no longer than 1h
- Every team member _should_ have something worth demoing by the time their team's hosting rotation comes around, but that won't always be the case, because of holidays, time off, sickness, and uncontrollable circumstances
- Engineers not on the hosting team should be able to sign up to demo something that they desire to demo (time permitting)
- To make demo day run smooth, a sign up schedule should be organized somewhere public and allow for asynchronous modification
    - use a google spreadsheet or a thread or note in slack
    - Demos will execute in order so there's no confusion of asking who wants to go
    - Include the engineer's name and brief description of what they'll be demoing
- Elect a MC (master of ceremonies) from the host team or a volunteer; they will facilitate meeting using the sign up sheet

## Demos
- Demo's should take between 5-15 minutes*
- The subject matter could be a new feature, service, spec, design, interesting bug fix, results of a performance test/change
    - It can also be something that has less direct business value: a tool you recently integrated with, a walk through of a devops procedure, some new technology that you read about, tested, and you think might have a place in the organization
- Demos should be shared on screen and be remote friendly
- Demos can be done via slide show, pre-recorded video, showing postman calls, output in a terminal, or clicking through a frontend client, but can also be as simple as talking while scrolling through code
- Clarifying questions are okay, but a demo is **not the place for critical comments**
    - Questions like, "Why didn't you do X?" or "Did you consider Y?" can be had offline
        - This is not the space for proving you're the smartest person in the room
    - The Demo'er is already under enough pressure having do demo in front of people
- A demo does not need to end with, "Are there any questions?". The demo can just end when the topic has been demoed
